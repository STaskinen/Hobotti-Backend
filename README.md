Hobotti-Backend is the server backend built with NODE.JS, EXPRESS.JS, SOCKET.IO and MongoDB that beats underneath Hobotti, a friend and hobby finding app for Android.

The Hobotti app was developed by five students of Metropolia University of Applied Sciences as a course project in partnership with the City of Helsinki in the fall of 2018, and it utualizes some of the open data provided by the city (As of right now this basicly means the utualization of the [Linked Events](https://dev.hel.fi/apis/linked-events/) and [Linked Courses](https://dev.hel.fi/apis/linked-courses/) APIs)
